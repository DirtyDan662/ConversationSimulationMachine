# ConversationSimulationMachine
Have a Conversation With Your Computer!



This modifed Blue J project enables the user to simulate a conversation with anyone imaginable.
The program takes two input files containing generic respones
and mapped responses. These files must be labled "default.txt" and "map.text"
respectively. 

These files allows the simulation toidentify an appropiate response to a phrase.
Of course, the success of these iterations is dependent on the quality of the two text files.

The two text files allows the conversation simulation to emulate any conversation
of any language. The limit of course, is the imaginination of the text file creator.
Currently, this program is configured to simulate a conversation with my fiance,
Emma, whom I know pretty well.

Good luck with this program, and have fun!
